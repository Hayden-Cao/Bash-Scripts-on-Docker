# Bash Script on Docker - Tutorial

**Goal:** Create bash scripts that will let you setup, run, and rerun the simulation in docker with scripts to avoid the hassle of typing and copy pasting multiple commands

**Note 1: To copy and paste anything into the terminal use the Right Mouse Button**  
**Note 2: I have only tried this on Windows machines running WSL**

# Prerequisite:  
This tutorial assumes you can open the simulation by entering each command manually
Install VSCode and the extension Dev Containers from the VSCode Marketplace

# Setup Steps:

**Step 1:** Open your terminal and run  
```bash
bash
```
```bash
cd mnt/c/Users/<your_user>
```

Make sure you change <your_user> with the name of the user on your PC
